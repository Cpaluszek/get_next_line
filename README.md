# get_next_line
This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

The project make student more confident with files manipulations, dynamic memory allocation and using pointers.<br/>
Also I get familiarized with static variables in this project.

`get_next_line` and `ft_printf` will be used a lot in future projects.
